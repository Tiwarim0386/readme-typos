Factors that affect errors
Spelling errors have traditionally been classified into
four descriptive types: Deletion, Insertion, Substitution
and Transposition (Damerau, 1964). For each
of these types, we investigated the potential causes
of error generation and correction, following previous
work (Aramaki et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2011).
Physical factors: (1) motor control of hands and fingers;
(2) distance between the keys; Visual factors:
(3) visual similarity of characters; (4) position in
a word; (5) same character repetition; Phonological
factors: (6) phonological similarity of characters/
words.
In what follows, our discussion is based on the
frequency ratio of particular error types, where the
frequency ratio refers to the number of cases in
spelling errors divided by the total number of cases
in all data. For example, the frequency ratio of consonant
deletion is calculated by dividing the number
of missing consonants in errors by the total number
of consonants.
4.3 Corrected vs. uncorrected errors in English
In this subsection, we compare corrected and uncorrected
errors of English, trying to uncover what factors
facilitate the error correction.
Error types (Figure 3) Errors in en keystroke are
dominated by Substitution, while Deletion errors are
the most common in en common, indicating that

Figure 5: Positions of errors within words
Substitution mistakes are easy to catch, while Deletion
mistakes tend to escape our attention. Zheng
et al. (2011) reports that their pinyin correction errors
are dominated by Deletion, which suggests that
their log does in fact reflect the characteristics of corrected
errors.
Position of error within a word (Figure 5) In
en keystroke, Deletion errors at the word-initial position
are the most common, while Insertion and
Substitution errors tend to occur both at the beginning
and the end of a word. In contrast, in
en common, all error types are more prone to occur
word-medially. This means that errors at word
edges are corrected more often than the wordinternal
errors, which can be attributed to cognitive
effect known as the bathtub effect (Aitchison, 1994),
which states that we memorize words at the periphery
most effectively in English.
Effect of character repetition (Figure 6) Deletion
errors where characters are repeated, as in
tomorow!tomorrow, is observed significantly
more frequently than in a non-repeating context in
en common, but no such difference is observed in
en keystroke, showing that visually conspicuous errors
tend to be corrected.
